An implementation of the distance-vector routing protocol on a router to control routing using link costs.
Routers send and update their routing tables until all the neighboring routing tables reach convergence following the Bellman-Ford equation, and packets are then forwarded along routers using these routing tables, reflecting the below network topology:
